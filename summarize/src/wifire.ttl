It operates in the green spectrum, thus enabling it to penetrate water. These two LiDAR mapping systems along with an Optech 12-bit full waveform digitizer were mounted consecutively in a twin-engine Piper PA-31-350 Navajo Chieftain (Tail Number N154WW). The third airborne sensor was for Hyperspectral imaging. This portion of the survey was performed with a CASI-1500 - a push broom type hyperspectral imaging sensor sold by ITRES.

Two points were captured for each tunnel, one at each tunnel opening. A line was then created either by tracing the NAVTEQ street / railroad, or, if there was not a NAVTEQ street / railroad coincident with the tunnel, then by a straight line joining the two points. For some tunnels, the NBI contains two records, one for the road through the tunnel and one for the road on top of the tunnel (if any). In these cases, both have been captured in this dataset. Features in this dataset that are over tunnels have a [RECTYPE] of &quot;1&quot;, while features that are in tunnels have a [RECTYPE] of &quot;2&quot;. Presumably, this was done because both roads could be blocked if the tunnel was destroyed. In some cases, the NBI only represented a tunnel with a record of type = &quot;1&quot; (over). In these cases, the following rules were applied: 1) If there was no road running through the tunnel, the road on top of the tunnel was captured. For example, if a mine conveyor runs through the tunnel and a county highway runs on top of the tunnel, the county highway was captured. 2) If a road ran through the tunnel, then this road was captured and the [RECTYPE] was changed to &quot;2&quot;. The &quot;feature carried&quot; and &quot;feature intersected&quot; fields were also changed to be consistent with the feature actually captured. According to the U.S. DOT: &quot;Our reporting requirements do not extend to tunnels, therefore, any info we have should be considered incomplete.&quot;</span></font>""" ;

The DCPP San Simeon project study area is located primarily in San Luis Obispo County, California, encompasses approximately 195,000 acres (801 km2), and measures 75 miles in length. Watershed Sciences, Inc. (WSI) collected Light Detection and Ranging (Lidar) data and orthophotography across the DCPP San Simeon survey area from 29 January 2013 to 25 February 2013. For optimal capture of the intertidal zone, WSI acquired Lidar data of the coastline during seasonal low tides between 7 February 2013 and 10 February 2013. The lidar survey utilized a Leica ALS70 sensor in a Cessna Caravan, and an Optech Orion sensor in a Bell Long Ranger. The Leica system was used for acquisition of the inland portion of the study area. It was set to acquire 240,000 laser pulses per second (i.e., 240 kHz pulse rate) and flown at 1,100 meters above ground level (AGL), capturing a scan angle of \u00c2\u00b115\u00c2\u00b0 from nadir. The Orion system was used to acquire the intertidal portion of the study area. It was set to acquire 175,000 laser pulses per second and flown at 300 meters AGL, capturing a scan angle of \u00c2\u00b113\u00c2\u00b0 from nadir. Both laser systems were programmed to yield an average native pulse density of \u00e2\u0089\u00a58 pulses per square meter over terrestrial surfaces. Digital orthophotos were collected using a 260 megapixel ultra large format digital aerial camera. Image radiometric values were calibrated to specific gain and exposure settings associated with each capture using Microsoft's UltraMap software suite. The calibrated images were saved in TIFF format for input to subsequent processes. Photo position and orientation were calculated by linking the time of image capture, the corresponding aircraft position and attitude, and the smoothed best estimate of trajectory (SBET) data in POSPAC. Within the Inpho software suite, automated aerial triangulation was performed to tie images together and to align with ground control. The orthophotos were delivered in 0.375 USGS tiles with a 3'' pixel resolution. This survey was flown in conjunction with the DCPP Senior Seismic Hazard Analysis Committee (SSHAC) Level 3 process and as part of the DCPP Long-Term Seismic Program (LTSP). In addition to aerial Lidar data, DEM and orthophotography raster data are available for this area: San Simeon DEMs and Orthophotos.""" ;

        :description """The data consists of seven HIGRAD/FIRETEC simulations, each with multiple time series (each 70 to 100 times steps) of 3D scalar fields on a curvilinear grid from coupled Higrad/Firetec simulations. These .vts (VTK structured grid data format, can be opened using Paraview) files were generated to study a phenomena known as vorticity-driven lateral spread in mountain and canyon topographies. There are six mountain and one canyon scenario. Simulations names are first tagged with the topographical structure - either mountain or valley. Mountain simulations are then tagged with either head curve or back curve to indicate whether the fire starts as a headfire or a backing fire and that the simulation is a part of a suite of simulations exploring the influence of the radius of curvature along the ridgeline. Finally, a numerical value is associated with each simulation - 40, 80 or 320. This value determines the radius of curvature or roundness of the peak of the mountain. A higher value indicates a more rounded ridgeline, resulting in a gentle hill top as opposed to a sharp pointy ridge. For questions, please contact Divya Banesh, dbanesh@lanl.gov.""" ;

Thus, the\ndissolved polygon layers should be used when requesting a map image (e.g. WMS\nGetMap or ArcGIS REST export operations), while the zone polygon layers should\nbe used when performing a query (e.g. WMS GetFeatureInfo or ArcGIS REST query\nor identify operations).\n</p>\n<p>\nThe colors used to identify the different watches, advisories, warnings, and\nstatements are the same colors used by the NWS on their map at\n<a href='http://www.weather.gov' target='_blank'>http://www.weather.gov</a>.\nThe NWS products for long-duration hazardous conditions are updated in the\nnowCOAST\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 map service approximately every 10 minutes.\nFor more detailed information about layer update frequency and timing, please reference the  \n<a href='//nowcoast.noaa.gov/help/#!section=updateschedule' target='_blank'>nowCOAST\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 Dataset Update Schedule</a>.\n</p> \n\nBackground Information\n\n<p>\nNWS watches depict the geographic areas where the risk of hazardous weather or\nhydrologic events has increased significantly, but their occurrence, location,\nand/or timing is still uncertain. A warning depicts where a hazardous weather\nor hydrologic event is occurring, is imminent, or has a very high probability\nof occurring. A warning is used for conditions posing a threat to life or\nproperty. Advisories indicate where special weather conditions are occurring,\nimminent, or have a very high probability of occurring but are less serious\nthan a warning. They are for events that may cause significant inconvenience,\nand if caution is not exercised, could lead to situations that may threaten\nlife and/or property. Statements usually contain updated information on a\nwarning and are used to let the public know when a warning is no longer in\neffect. NWS issues over 75 different types of watches, warnings, and advisories\n(WWAs). WWAs are issued by the NWS regional Weather Forecast Offices (WFOs) and\nalso the NWS Ocean Prediction Center, National Hurricane Center, Central\nPacific Hurricane Center, and Storm Prediction Center.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe NWS WWAs are organized on the nowCOAST\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 map viewer and within this\nmap service by hazardous condition/threat layer groups and then by the\ngeographic area (i.e. coastal &amp; inland, immediate coast or maritime) for\nwhich the WWA product is targeted. This was done to allow users to select WWAs\nfor hazardous conditions that are important to their operations or activities.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nPlease note that the Tropical Storm and Hurricane Warnings are provided in both\nthe High Wind Hazards: Maritime Areas and Coastal &amp; Inland Areas layer\ngroups and the Flooding Hazards: Coastal Areas layer group. These warnings are\nincluded in the Flooding Hazards/Coastal Areas layer group because the NWS uses\nthose warnings to inform the public that tropical storm or hurricane winds may\nbe accompanied by significant coastal flooding but below the thresholds\nrequired for the issuance of a storm surge warning. In addition, a tropical\nstorm or hurricane warning may remain in effect when dangerously high water or\na combination of dangerously high water and waves continue, even though the\nwinds may be less than hurricane or tropical storm force. The NWS does not\nissue a Coastal Flood Warning or Advisory when a tropical storm or hurricane\nwarning is in effect; however that does not mean that there is not a\nsignificant coastal flooding threat.\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    High Wind Hazards (Associated with Non-Tropical &amp;

If the time parameter is specified in a request, the data or imagery\nmost relevant to the provided time value, if any, will be returned. If the time\nparameter is not specified in a request, the latest data or imagery valid for\nthe present system time will be returned to the client. If the time parameter\nis not specified and no data or imagery is available for the present time, no\ndata will be returned.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThis service is configured with time coverage support, meaning that the service\nwill always return the most relevant available data, if any, to the specified\ntime value. For example, if the service contains data valid today at 12:00 and\n12:10 UTC, but a map request specifies a time value of today at 12:07 UTC, the\ndata valid at 12:10 UTC will be returned to the user. This behavior allows more\nflexibility for users, especially when displaying multiple time-enabled layers\ntogether despite slight differences in temporal resolution or update frequency.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen interacting with this time-enabled service, only a single instantaneous\ntime value should be specified in each request. If instead a time range is\nspecified in a request (i.e. separate start time and end time values are\ngiven), the data returned may be different than what was intended.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCare must be taken to ensure the time value specified in each request falls\nwithin the current time coverage of the service. Because this service is\nfrequently updated as new data becomes available, the user must periodically\ndetermine the service's time extent. However, due to software limitations, the\ntime extent of the service and map layers as advertised by ArcGIS Server does\nnot always provide the most up-to-date start and end times of available data.\nInstead, users have three options for determining the latest time extent of the\nservice:\n</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>\n\t\tIssue a returnUpdates=true request (ArcGIS REST protocol only)\n\t\tfor an individual layer or for the service itself, which will return\n\t\tthe current start and end times of available data, in epoch time format\n\t\t(milliseconds since 00:00 January 1, 1970). To see an example, click on\n\t\tthe &quot;Return Updates&quot; link at the bottom of the REST Service page under\n\t\t&quot;Supported Operations&quot;. Refer to the\n\t\t<a href='http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/arcgis-rest-api/index.html#//02r3000000w2000000' target='_blank'>ArcGIS REST API Map Service Documentation</a>\n\t\tfor more information.\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tIssue an Identify (ArcGIS REST) or GetFeatureInfo (WMS) request against\n\t\tthe proper layer corresponding with the target dataset. For raster\n\t\tdata, this would be the &quot;Image Footprints with Time Attributes&quot; layer\n\t\tin the same group as the target &quot;Image&quot; layer being displayed. For\n\t\tvector (point, line, or polygon) data, the target layer can be queried\n\t\tdirectly. In either case, the attributes returned for the matching\n\t\traster(s) or vector feature(s) will include the following:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\tvalidtime: Valid timestamp.\n\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\tstarttime: Display start time.\n\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\tendtime: Display end time.\n\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\treftime: Reference time (sometimes referred to as\n\t\t\t\tissuance time, cycle time, or initialization time).\n\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\tprojmins: Number of minutes from reference time to valid\n\t\t\t\ttime.\n\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\tdesigreftime: Designated reference time; used as a\n\t\t\t\tcommon reference time for all items when individual reference\n\t\t\t\ttimes do not match.\n\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\tdesigprojmins: Number of minutes from designated\n\t\t\t\treference time to valid time.\n\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tQuery the nowCOAST\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 LayerInfo web service, which has been created to\n\t\tprovide additional information about each data layer in a service,\n\t\tincluding a list of all available &quot;time stops&quot; (i.e. &quot;valid times&quot;),\n\t\tindividual timestamps, or the valid time of a layer's latest available\n\t\tdata (i.e. &quot;Product Time&quot;).

A few examples include Gale Watch, Gale Warning, High Surf Advisory, High Wind Watch, Areal Flood Warning, Coastal Flood Watch, Winter Storm Warning, Wind Chill Advisory, Frost Advisory, Tropical Storm Watch, Red Flag Warning, Air Stagnation Warning, and Beach Hazards Statement. (A complete list is given in the Background Information section below.) The coverage areas of these products are usually defined by county or sub-county boundaries.

However, a set of equivalent layers containing the\r\noriginal individual zone geometries are also included for querying purposes,\r\nand are indicated with the suffix &quot;(Zone Polygons)&quot;. Corresponding zone polygon\r\nand dissolved polygon layers are matched together in group layers for each WWA\r\ncategory. The zone polygon layers are included in this service only to support\r\nquery/identify operations (e.g., in order to retrieve the original zone\r\ngeometry or other attributes such as a URL to the warning text bulletin) and\r\nthus will not be drawn when included in a normal map image request. Thus, the\r\ndissolved polygon layers should be used when requesting a map image (e.g. WMS\r\nGetMap or ArcGIS REST export operations), while the zone polygon layers should\r\nbe used when performing a query (e.g. WMS GetFeatureInfo or ArcGIS REST query\r\nor identify operations).\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe colors used to identify the different watches, advisories, warnings, and\r\nstatements are the same colors used by the NWS on their map at\r\n<a href='http://www.weather.gov' target='_blank'>http://www.weather.gov</a>.\r\nThe NWS products for long-duration hazardous conditions are updated in the\r\nnowCOAST\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 map service approximately every 10 minutes.\r\nFor more detailed information about layer update frequency and timing, please reference the  \r\n<a href='//nowcoast.noaa.gov/help/#!section=updateschedule' target='_blank'>nowCOAST\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 Dataset Update Schedule</a>.\r\n</p> \r\n\r\nBackground Information\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNWS watches depict the geographic areas where the risk of hazardous weather or\r\nhydrologic events has increased significantly, but their occurrence, location,\r\nand/or timing is still uncertain. A warning depicts where a hazardous weather\r\nor hydrologic event is occurring, is imminent, or has a very high probability\r\nof occurring. A warning is used for conditions posing a threat to life or\r\nproperty. Advisories indicate where special weather conditions are occurring,\r\nimminent, or have a very high probability of occurring but are less serious\r\nthan a warning. They are for events that may cause significant inconvenience,\r\nand if caution is not exercised, could lead to situations that may threaten\r\nlife and/or property. Statements usually contain updated information on a\r\nwarning and are used to let the public know when a warning is no longer in\r\neffect. NWS issues over 75 different types of watches, warnings, and advisories\r\n(WWAs). WWAs are issued by the NWS regional Weather Forecast Offices (WFOs) and\r\nalso the NWS Ocean Prediction Center, National Hurricane Center, Central\r\nPacific Hurricane Center, and Storm Prediction Center.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe NWS WWAs are organized on the nowCOAST\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 map viewer and within this\r\nmap service by hazardous condition/threat layer groups and then by the\r\ngeographic area (i.e. coastal &amp; inland, immediate coast or maritime) for\r\nwhich the WWA product is targeted. This was done to allow users to select WWAs\r\nfor hazardous conditions that are important to their operations or activities.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nPlease note that the Tropical Storm and Hurricane Warnings are provided in both\r\nthe High Wind Hazards: Maritime Areas and Coastal &amp; Inland Areas layer\r\ngroups and the Flooding Hazards: Coastal Areas layer group. These warnings are\r\nincluded in the Flooding Hazards/Coastal Areas layer group because the NWS uses\r\nthose warnings to inform the public that tropical storm or hurricane winds may\r\nbe accompanied by significant coastal flooding but below the thresholds\r\nrequired for the issuance of a storm surge warning. In addition, a tropical\r\nstorm or hurricane warning may remain in effect when dangerously high water or\r\na combination of dangerously high water and waves continue, even though the\r\nwinds may be less than hurricane or tropical storm force. The NWS does not\r\nissue a Coastal Flood Warning or Advisory when a tropical storm or hurricane\r\nwarning is in effect; however that does not mean that there is not a\r\nsignificant coastal flooding threat.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>\r\n    High Wind Hazards (Associated with Non-Tropical &amp;

If the time parameter is specified in a request, the data or imagery\r\nmost relevant to the provided time value, if any, will be returned. If the time\r\nparameter is not specified in a request, the latest data or imagery valid for\r\nthe present system time will be returned to the client. If the time parameter\r\nis not specified and no data or imagery is available for the present time, no\r\ndata will be returned.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis service is configured with time coverage support, meaning that the service\r\nwill always return the most relevant available data, if any, to the specified\r\ntime value. For example, if the service contains data valid today at 12:00 and\r\n12:10 UTC, but a map request specifies a time value of today at 12:07 UTC, the\r\ndata valid at 12:10 UTC will be returned to the user. This behavior allows more\r\nflexibility for users, especially when displaying multiple time-enabled layers\r\ntogether despite slight differences in temporal resolution or update frequency.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen interacting with this time-enabled service, only a single instantaneous\r\ntime value should be specified in each request. If instead a time range is\r\nspecified in a request (i.e. separate start time and end time values are\r\ngiven), the data returned may be different than what was intended.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nCare must be taken to ensure the time value specified in each request falls\r\nwithin the current time coverage of the service. Because this service is\r\nfrequently updated as new data becomes available, the user must periodically\r\ndetermine the service's time extent. However, due to software limitations, the\r\ntime extent of the service and map layers as advertised by ArcGIS Server does\r\nnot always provide the most up-to-date start and end times of available data.\r\nInstead, users have three options for determining the latest time extent of the\r\nservice:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tIssue a returnUpdates=true request (ArcGIS REST protocol only)\r\n\t\tfor an individual layer or for the service itself, which will return\r\n\t\tthe current start and end times of available data, in epoch time format\r\n\t\t(milliseconds since 00:00 January 1, 1970). To see an example, click on\r\n\t\tthe &quot;Return Updates&quot; link at the bottom of the REST Service page under\r\n\t\t&quot;Supported Operations&quot;. Refer to the\r\n\t\t<a href='http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/arcgis-rest-api/index.html#//02r3000000w2000000' target='_blank'>ArcGIS REST API Map Service Documentation</a>\r\n\t\tfor more information.\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tIssue an Identify (ArcGIS REST) or GetFeatureInfo (WMS) request against\r\n\t\tthe proper layer corresponding with the target dataset. For raster\r\n\t\tdata, this would be the &quot;Image Footprints with Time Attributes&quot; layer\r\n\t\tin the same group as the target &quot;Image&quot; layer being displayed. For\r\n\t\tvector (point, line, or polygon) data, the target layer can be queried\r\n\t\tdirectly. In either case, the attributes returned for the matching\r\n\t\traster(s) or vector feature(s) will include the following:\r\n\t\t<ul>\r\n\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\tvalidtime: Valid timestamp.\r\n\t\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\tstarttime: Display start time.\r\n\t\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\tendtime: Display end time.\r\n\t\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\treftime: Reference time (sometimes referred to as\r\n\t\t\t\tissuance time, cycle time, or initialization time).\r\n\t\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\tprojmins: Number of minutes from reference time to valid\r\n\t\t\t\ttime.\r\n\t\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\tdesigreftime: Designated reference time; used as a\r\n\t\t\t\tcommon reference time for all items when individual reference\r\n\t\t\t\ttimes do not match.\r\n\t\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\tdesigprojmins: Number of minutes from designated\r\n\t\t\t\treference time to valid time.\r\n\t\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tQuery the nowCOAST\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 LayerInfo web service, which has been created to\r\n\t\tprovide additional information about each data layer in a service,\r\n\t\tincluding a list of all available &quot;time stops&quot; (i.e. &quot;valid times&quot;),\r\n\t\tindividual timestamps, or the valid time of a layer's latest available\r\n\t\tdata (i.e. &quot;Product Time&quot;).

The service area is the geographic area within which a 911 call placed using a landline is answered at the associated PSAP. This dataset only includes primary PSAPs. Secondary PSAPs, backup PSAPs, and wireless PSAPs have been excluded from this dataset. Primary PSAPs receive calls directly, whereas secondary PSAPs receive calls that have been transferred by a primary PSAP. Backup PSAPs provide service in cases where another PSAP is inoperable. Most military bases have their own emergency telephone systems. To connect to such a system from within a military base, it may be necessary to dial a number other than 9 1 1. Due to the sensitive nature of military installations, TGS did not actively research these systems. If civilian authorities in surrounding areas volunteered information about these systems, or if adding a military PSAP was necessary to fill a hole in civilian provided data, TGS included it in this dataset. Otherwise, military installations are depicted as being covered by one or more adjoining civilian emergency telephone systems. In some cases, areas are covered by more than one PSAP boundary. In these cases, any of the applicable PSAPs may take a 911 call. Where a specific call is routed may depend on how busy the applicable PSAPs are (i.e., load balancing), operational status (i.e., redundancy), or time of day / day of week. If an area does not have 911 service, TGS included that area in the dataset along with the address and phone number of their dispatch center. These are areas where someone must dial a 7 or 10 digit number to get emergency services. These records can be identified by a &quot;Y&quot; in the [NON911EMNO] field. This indicates that dialing 911 inside one of these areas does not connect one with emergency services. This dataset was constructed by gathering information about PSAPs from state level officials. In some cases, this was geospatial information; in other cases, it was tabular. This information was supplemented with a list of PSAPs from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Each PSAP was researched to verify its tabular information. In cases where the source data was not geospatial, each PSAP was researched to determine its service area in terms of existing boundaries (e.g., city and county boundaries). In some cases, existing boundaries had to be modified to reflect coverage areas (e.g., &quot;entire county north of Country Road 30&quot;). However, there may be cases where minor deviations from existing boundaries are not reflected in this dataset, such as the case where a particular PSAPs coverage area includes an entire county plus the homes and businesses along a road which is partly in another county. At the request of NGA, text fields in this dataset have been set to all upper case to facilitate consistent database engine search results. At the request of NGA, all diacritics (e.g., the German umlaut or the Spanish tilde) have been replaced with their closest equivalent English character to facilitate use with database systems that may not support diacritics.</span></font><div><span style='font-family: &quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);'><font size='4'><br /></font></span></div><div><span style='font-family: &quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);'><font size='4'>Homeland Security Use Cases: Use cases describe how the data may be used and help to define and clarify requirements. 1) A disaster has struck, or is predicted for, a locality.

This information is coupled with calibrated weather model output (comprised of wind speed and atmospheric moisture), to generate a 6-day forecast of Large Fire Potential. The Large Fire Potential output is then compared to climatological data and historical fire occurrence to establish the index rating.

It contains lands owned (fee title), some operated (wildlife areas, ecological reserves, and public/fishing access properties that are leases/agreements with other agencies that may be publicly accessible) and conservation easements held by CDFW. CDFW Owned and Operated Lands and Conservation Easements replaces the prior dataset, DFG Owned and Operated Lands, which included only fee title lands and some operated lands (wildlife areas, ecological reserves, and public/fishing access properties that are leases/agreements with other agencies and that may be publicly accessible). This is a generalized version dataset that has a shorter attribute table than the original and also has been dissolved based on the fields included. Please note that some lands may not be accessible due to the protection of resources and habitat. It is recommended that users contact the appropriate regional office for access information and consult regulations for CDFW lands in Sections 550, 550.1, 551, 552, 630 and 702. The CDFW Lands dataset is a digitized geographical inventory of selected lands owned and/or administered by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. Properties such as ecological reserves, wildlife areas, undesignated lands containing biological resource values, public and fishing access lands, and CDFW fish hatcheries are among those lands included in this inventory. Types of properties owned or administered by CDFW which may not be included in this dataset are parcels less than 1 acre in size, such as fishing piers, fish spawning grounds, fish barriers, and other minor parcels. Physical boundaries of individual parcels are determined by the descriptions contained in legal documents and assessor parcel maps relating to that parcel. The approximate parcel boundaries are drawn onto U.S. Geological Survey 7.5'-series topographic maps, then digitized and attributed before being added to the dataset. In some cases, assessor parcel or best available datasets are used to digitize the boundary. Using parcel data to adjust the boundaries is a work in progress and will be incorporated in the future. Township, range, and section lines were based on the U.S. Geological Survey 7.5' series topographic maps (1:24,000 - scale).

The West rectangle is located 35 km NW of Iowa City, Iowa and the East rectangle is located 10 km NW of the same city. This survey was performed with 2 different LiDAR systems: 1) Optech Gemini Airborne Laser Terrain Mapper (ALTM) which is an infrared laser mapping sensor and 2) Optech Aquarius ALTM which is a hybrid laser mapping system as it collects simultaneous land and shallow water-depth measurements. It operates in the green spectrum, thus enabling it to penetrate water. These LiDAR mapping systems along with an Optech 12-bit full waveform digitizer were mounted consecutively in a twin-engine Piper PA- 31-350 Navajo Chieftain (Tail Number N154WW).

This data was collected in collaboration between the National Center for Airborne Laser Mapping (NCALM) project and the Boulder Creek Critical Zone Observatory (CZO), both funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF). The dataset contains 1 m Digital Surface Models (first-stop), Digital Terrain Models (bare-earth), and 10 points/m2 LAS-formated point cloud tiles. The DSMs and DTMs are available in GeoTIFF format, approx. 1-2 GB each, with associated shaded relief models, for a total of 15 GB of data. The Digital Terrain Model (DTM) is a ground-surface elevation dataset better suited for derived layers such as slope angle, aspect, and contours. Accessory layers consist of index map layers for point cloud tiles, DEM extent, and flight lines. Other LiDAR DSMs, DTMs, and point cloud data available in this series include snow-on data for 2010. Together, the LiDAR Digital Elevation Models (DEM) and point cloud data will be of interest to land managers, scientists, and others for study of topography, snow, ecosystems and environmental change. The Boulder Creek CZO will be using the LiDAR data to further their mission of focusing on how water, atmosphere, ecosystems, & soils interact and shape the Earth's surface. The \"Critical Zone\" lies between rock and sky. It is essential to life - including human food production - and helps drive Earth's carbon cycle, climate change, stream runoff, and water quality. PLEASE READ the FGDC-compliant metadata files that are available for each dataset (in .html, .txt, and .xml formats). These files provide numerous details that may be of interest.

Lidar data from the Nyack Floodplain on the Middle Fork of the Flathead River was collected for several purposes. The first was to provide a base image from which we could place a network of groundwater wells. The data was also used combination with optical remotes sensing data, both airborne and satellite, to identify pixels within multispectral optical imagery that corresponded to various vegetation height elevations. Those pixels were then separately classified by vegetation type. Data was also used to conduct simple flood inundation modeling of the floodplain and in combination with measures of flow depth and velocity extracting water surface elevation from the lidar to map the spatial distribution of stream power. This area has a repeat survey from May 2005: Flathead Lake Biological Station, MT (May 2005).""" ;

We used multitemporal airborne laser scanning (ALS), combined with field data, to empirically model these variables at fine scales (5 m resolution). We acquired Fuel Characteristic Classification System (FCCS) estimates of fuel load through LANDFIRE (30 m resolution) and estimated fuel consumption using CONSUME in the software program Fuel and Fire Tools (FFT). This data publication contains pre/post fire fuel load and fuel consumption for the 2018 Keithly Fire (Idaho, USA) using each of the ALS and FCCS approaches.

Road\ncenterline information is collected from recorded documents (subdivision and\nparcel maps) and information provided by local jurisidictions (Cities in San Diego\nCounty, County of San Diego). Road names and address ranges are as designated\nby the official address coordinator for each jurisidcition. Jurisdictional information\nis created from spatial overlays with other data layers (e.g. Jurisdiction, Census\nTract).The layer contains both public and private roads. Not all roads are shown on\nofficial, recorded documents. Centerlines may be included for dedicated public\nroads even if they have not been constructed. Public road names are the official names as maintained by the addressing authority for the jurisdiction in which the\nroad is located. Official road names may not match the common or local name\nused to identify the road (e.g. State Route 94 is the official name of certain road\nsegments commonly referred to as Campo Road).Private roads are either named\nor unnamed. Named private roads are as shown on official recorded documents or\nas directed by the addressing authority for the jurisdiction in which the road is\nlocated. Unnamed private roads are included where requested by the local\njurisidiction or by SanGIS JPA members (primarily emergency response dispatch\nagencies). Roads are comprised of road segments that are individually identified by\na unique, and persistent, ID (ROADSEGID). Roads segments are terminated where\nthey intersect with each other, at jurisdictional boundaries (i.e. city limits), certain\ncensus tract and law beat boundaries, at locations where road names change, and\nat other locations as required by SanGIS JPA members. Each road segment\nterminates at an intersection point that can be found in the\nROADS_INTERSECTION layer.Road centerlines do not necessarily follow the\ncenterline of dedicated rights-of-way (ROW). Centerlines are adjusted as needed\nto fit the actual, constructed roadway. However, many road centerline segments\nare created intially based on record documents prior to construction and may not\nhave been updated to meet as-built locations. Please notify SanGIS if the actual\nlocation differs from that shown. See the SanGIS website for contact information\nand reporting problems (http://www.sangis.org/contact/problem.html).Note, the\nroad speeds in this layer are based on road segment class and were published as\npart of an agreement between San Diego Fire-Rescue, the San Diego County Sheriff's Department, and SanGIS.

The final data collection has an area of 246 km2 The Harper lake fault is aligned between the towns of Barstow and Ridgecrest, California. Two flights were required to collect the data. Both flights took place on Sunday June 17, 2012. It was collected on a Sunday because part of the survey area are underneath Restricted airspace controlled by the Edwards Air Force Base and access to it is preferably granted on Sundays. Also due to airspace restrictions the flying height above average ground was 900m rather than the preferred 600m.

        :description """These airborne lidar data were gathered by the Instituto Nacional de Estadistica y Geografia of Mexico as part of a regional mapping activity in northwestern Mexico. They span the area that ruptured in the April 2010 M7.2 El Mayor Cucupah earthquake which was laser scanned and for which data are available in OpenTopography's holdings. Alejandro Hinojosa of CICESE is the contact person for these data. This version of the data has been empirically corrected by Craig Glennie and colleagues at the University of Houston. Details for the data corrections as follows: Rather than trying to correct the whole dataset, we just concentrated on the portion that overlaps with the post-event data. Here is a brief summary of what we did: (1) Pre-Event Data was given in ITRF 1992 (1988.0 epoch) and post-event NCALM data was processed in ITRF2000 (Epoch 2010.627). NGS software package HTDP was used to compute a coordinate shift between these two reference frames (-0.900 m East, 0.429 m North, 0.004 m Up). To correct the 2006 data to the same datum as the NCALM data, we added the vector (-0.900,0.429,0.004) to all of the pre-event data points. (2) Original dataset contained all scan data out to +/- 28 degree scan angle. There are significant problems at the outer edge of the scan, so all scan lines were cropped to +/-24 degrees. This results in minimal overlap between scan lines, but doesn't create any data gaps between flight lines. (3)Dataset was then re-boresighted. We determined a roll and pitch offset for each flight line individually, plus a global mirror scale factor. (4) Finally, we determined an individual delta \"z\" correction for each flightline. Note that for all of the above adjustments, none of the post-earthquake data was used. We purposely sequestered the two datasets so as not to inadvertently remove differences caused by the earthquake. To give an idea of the magnitude of the improvement, on the pre-event dataset (as delivered to me) in the overlap, we were seeing average elevation differences of 95 cm (1 sigma). After cropping the data to 24 degrees, the average elevation differences were 70 cm (1 sigma) After steps (3) and (4) above, the average elevation differences were reduced to 52 cm (1 sigma). So overall, it appears we were able to reduce the vertical errors by almost a factor of two.""" ;

The DCPP Los Osos project study area is located in San Luis Obispo County, California, and encompasses approximately 170,000 acres (674.59 square kilometers). Watershed Sciences, Inc. (WSI) collected Light Detection and Ranging (Lidar) data across the project area from 17 March 2011 to 31 March 2011. The lidar survey utilized a Leica ALS60 sensor in a Cessna Caravan. The Leica system was set to acquire 105,900 laser pulses per second (i.e., 105.9 kHz pulse rate) and flown at 900 meters above ground level (AGL), capturing a scan angle of \u00c2\u00b114\u00c2\u00b0 from nadir when clouds and terrain permitted. With these flight parameters, the laser swath width is 449m and the laser pulse footprint is 21cm. These settings yield an average native pulse density of \u00e2\u0089\u00a58 pulses per square meter over terrestrial surfaces. This survey was flown as part of the DCPP Long-Term Seismic Program (LTSP). In addition to aerial Lidar data, DEM raster data are available for this area: Los Osos DEMs.""" ;

        :description """This airborne LiDAR dataset collected by NCALM, covers two sites. Site one is a coastal strip (4.5 x 0.4 km) of Salsipuedes Bay, in Baja California, Mexico. It is centered on km 93 of the Ensenada-Tijuana Scenic Highway 1D traversing sea cliffs with steep slopes, cutting exhumed marine sediments of the Rosario formation that are capped in part by the basaltic Rosarito Beach formation. On the night of December 27, 2013, a 220m long segment of the highway, at km 93, started to slide down towards the ocean. The movement continued for several hours until it stabilized the following day after, having displaced a volume close to 300 x 103 m3 of sandstone 35m down and 25m towards the Pacific Ocean. It took almost a year to repair this massive landslide and reestablish traffic through the main gateway to the Baja California Peninsula. This dataset was collected 186 days after the landslide when reconstruction was already taking place. Site two is Punta Morro, where Ensenada's science cluster is located, hosting CICESE, UNAM and UABC campuses.""" ;

The dataset contains 1 m Digital Surface Models (first-stop), Digital Terrain Models (bare-earth), and 10 points/m2 LAS-formated point cloud tiles. The DSMs and DTMs are available in GeoTIFF format with associated shaded relief models. The Digital Terrain Model (DTM) is a ground-surface elevation dataset better suited for derived layers such as slope angle, aspect, and contours. Accessory layers consist of index map layers for point cloud tiles, DEM extent, and flight lines. Other LiDAR DSMs, DTMs, and point cloud data available in this series include snow-off data for 2010. Together, the LiDAR Digital Elevation Models (DEM) and point cloud data will be of interest to land managers, scientists, and others for study of topography, snow, ecosystems and environmental change. The Boulder Creek CZO will be using the LiDAR data to further their mission of focusing on how water, atmosphere, ecosystems, & soils interact and shape the Earth's surface. The \"Critical Zone\" lies between rock and sky. It is essential to life - including human food production - and helps drive Earth's carbon cycle, climate change, stream runoff, and water quality. Read the FGDC-compliant metadata files that are available for each dataset (in .html, .txt, and .xml formats). These files provide numerous details that may be of interest. IMPORTANT NOTE: Due to weather and equipment failures the snow-on surveys were flown during 2 different time periods in May, between which there were substantial snow accumulations. Do not combine data from May 5/9, 2010 and May 20/21, 2010.""" ;

The lidar data and terrain products enables analysis of insolation using the GRASS GIS implementation of the SOLPOS 2.0 (SOLar POSition and intensity) algorithm developed and maintained by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).

The lidar survey was conducted by vendor Horizon's, 3600 Jet Drive, South Dakota. Lidar instrument was flown with Leica ALS40 over the period of Aug, 13-14, 2003. The data were delivered in ASCII format with information on return number, easting, northing, elevation and intensity for each return. The ascii files were converted to las format and classified using the Multiscale Curvature Classification (MCC) method of Evans and Hudak (2007). The primary goal of the study is to provide operational implementation of Lidar technology in support of project level planning. The proposed applications of Lidar in support of planning are: vegetation structural modeling, erosion modeling, fuels, transportation planning, timber system planning, wildlife habitat modeling, and stream quality. The Rocky Mountain Research Station will provide the development of peer-reviewed forest structural metrics and technical support in implementation of Lidar technology. The technical specifications have been defined to specifically support vegetation modeling using Lidar data.

The ascii files were converted to las format and classified using the Multiscale Curvature Classification (MCC) method of Evans and Hudak (2007). This project is the data acquisition phase of an administrative study being done by Rocky Mountain Research Station - Forest Sciences Lab, Moscow, ID. The primary goal of the study is to provide operational implementation of Lidar technology in support of project level planning. The proposed applications of Lidar in support of planning are: vegetation structural modeling, erosion modeling, fuels, transportation planning, timber system planning, wildlife habitat modeling, and stream quality. The Rocky Mountain Research Station will provide the development of peer-reviewed forest structural metrics and technical support in implementation of Lidar technology. The technical specifications have been defined to specifically support vegetation modeling using Lidar data. The St. Joe National Forest area consists of one contiguous block totaling ~ 55684 hectares in north central Idaho, between Deary and Clarkia. The project area consists of moderately variable topographic configurations with diverse vegetation components.""" ;

Thus, the\r\ndissolved polygon layers should be used when requesting a map image (e.g. WMS\r\nGetMap or ArcGIS REST export operations), while the zone polygon layers should\r\nbe used when performing a query (e.g. WMS GetFeatureInfo or ArcGIS REST query\r\nor identify operations).\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe colors used to identify the different watches, advisories, warnings, and\r\nstatements are the same colors used by the NWS on their map at\r\n<a href='http://www.weather.gov' target='_blank'>http://www.weather.gov</a>.\r\nThe NWS products for long-duration hazardous conditions are updated in the\r\nnowCOAST\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 map service approximately every 10 minutes.\r\nFor more detailed information about layer update frequency and timing, please reference the  \r\n<a href='//nowcoast.noaa.gov/help/#!section=updateschedule' target='_blank'>nowCOAST\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 Dataset Update Schedule</a>.\r\n</p> \r\n\r\nBackground Information\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNWS watches depict the geographic areas where the risk of hazardous weather or\r\nhydrologic events has increased significantly, but their occurrence, location,\r\nand/or timing is still uncertain. A warning depicts where a hazardous weather\r\nor hydrologic event is occurring, is imminent, or has a very high probability\r\nof occurring. A warning is used for conditions posing a threat to life or\r\nproperty. Advisories indicate where special weather conditions are occurring,\r\nimminent, or have a very high probability of occurring but are less serious\r\nthan a warning. They are for events that may cause significant inconvenience,\r\nand if caution is not exercised, could lead to situations that may threaten\r\nlife and/or property. Statements usually contain updated information on a\r\nwarning and are used to let the public know when a warning is no longer in\r\neffect. NWS issues over 75 different types of watches, warnings, and advisories\r\n(WWAs). WWAs are issued by the NWS regional Weather Forecast Offices (WFOs) and\r\nalso the NWS Ocean Prediction Center, National Hurricane Center, Central\r\nPacific Hurricane Center, and Storm Prediction Center.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe NWS WWAs are organized on the nowCOAST\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 map viewer and within this\r\nmap service by hazardous condition/threat layer groups and then by the\r\ngeographic area (i.e. coastal &amp; inland, immediate coast or maritime) for\r\nwhich the WWA product is targeted. This was done to allow users to select WWAs\r\nfor hazardous conditions that are important to their operations or activities.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nPlease note that the Tropical Storm and Hurricane Warnings are provided in both\r\nthe High Wind Hazards: Maritime Areas and Coastal &amp; Inland Areas layer\r\ngroups and the Flooding Hazards: Coastal Areas layer group. These warnings are\r\nincluded in the Flooding Hazards/Coastal Areas layer group because the NWS uses\r\nthose warnings to inform the public that tropical storm or hurricane winds may\r\nbe accompanied by significant coastal flooding but below the thresholds\r\nrequired for the issuance of a storm surge warning. In addition, a tropical\r\nstorm or hurricane warning may remain in effect when dangerously high water or\r\na combination of dangerously high water and waves continue, even though the\r\nwinds may be less than hurricane or tropical storm force. The NWS does not\r\nissue a Coastal Flood Warning or Advisory when a tropical storm or hurricane\r\nwarning is in effect; however that does not mean that there is not a\r\nsignificant coastal flooding threat.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>\r\n    High Wind Hazards (Associated with Non-Tropical &amp;

If the time parameter is specified in a request, the data or imagery\r\nmost relevant to the provided time value, if any, will be returned. If the time\r\nparameter is not specified in a request, the latest data or imagery valid for\r\nthe present system time will be returned to the client. If the time parameter\r\nis not specified and no data or imagery is available for the present time, no\r\ndata will be returned.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis service is configured with time coverage support, meaning that the service\r\nwill always return the most relevant available data, if any, to the specified\r\ntime value. For example, if the service contains data valid today at 12:00 and\r\n12:10 UTC, but a map request specifies a time value of today at 12:07 UTC, the\r\ndata valid at 12:10 UTC will be returned to the user. This behavior allows more\r\nflexibility for users, especially when displaying multiple time-enabled layers\r\ntogether despite slight differences in temporal resolution or update frequency.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen interacting with this time-enabled service, only a single instantaneous\r\ntime value should be specified in each request. If instead a time range is\r\nspecified in a request (i.e. separate start time and end time values are\r\ngiven), the data returned may be different than what was intended.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nCare must be taken to ensure the time value specified in each request falls\r\nwithin the current time coverage of the service. Because this service is\r\nfrequently updated as new data becomes available, the user must periodically\r\ndetermine the service's time extent. However, due to software limitations, the\r\ntime extent of the service and map layers as advertised by ArcGIS Server does\r\nnot always provide the most up-to-date start and end times of available data.\r\nInstead, users have three options for determining the latest time extent of the\r\nservice:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tIssue a returnUpdates=true request (ArcGIS REST protocol only)\r\n\t\tfor an individual layer or for the service itself, which will return\r\n\t\tthe current start and end times of available data, in epoch time format\r\n\t\t(milliseconds since 00:00 January 1, 1970). To see an example, click on\r\n\t\tthe &quot;Return Updates&quot; link at the bottom of the REST Service page under\r\n\t\t&quot;Supported Operations&quot;. Refer to the\r\n\t\t<a href='http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/arcgis-rest-api/index.html#//02r3000000w2000000' target='_blank'>ArcGIS REST API Map Service Documentation</a>\r\n\t\tfor more information.\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tIssue an Identify (ArcGIS REST) or GetFeatureInfo (WMS) request against\r\n\t\tthe proper layer corresponding with the target dataset. For raster\r\n\t\tdata, this would be the &quot;Image Footprints with Time Attributes&quot; layer\r\n\t\tin the same group as the target &quot;Image&quot; layer being displayed. For\r\n\t\tvector (point, line, or polygon) data, the target layer can be queried\r\n\t\tdirectly. In either case, the attributes returned for the matching\r\n\t\traster(s) or vector feature(s) will include the following:\r\n\t\t<ul>\r\n\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\tvalidtime: Valid timestamp.\r\n\t\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\tstarttime: Display start time.\r\n\t\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\tendtime: Display end time.\r\n\t\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\treftime: Reference time (sometimes referred to as\r\n\t\t\t\tissuance time, cycle time, or initialization time).\r\n\t\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\tprojmins: Number of minutes from reference time to valid\r\n\t\t\t\ttime.\r\n\t\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\tdesigreftime: Designated reference time; used as a\r\n\t\t\t\tcommon reference time for all items when individual reference\r\n\t\t\t\ttimes do not match.\r\n\t\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\tdesigprojmins: Number of minutes from designated\r\n\t\t\t\treference time to valid time.\r\n\t\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tQuery the nowCOAST\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 LayerInfo web service, which has been created to\r\n\t\tprovide additional information about each data layer in a service,\r\n\t\tincluding a list of all available &quot;time stops&quot; (i.e. &quot;valid times&quot;),\r\n\t\tindividual timestamps, or the valid time of a layer's latest available\r\n\t\tdata (i.e. &quot;Product Time&quot;).

Field work was completed over 3 \u00c2\u00bd days in February, 2020 when 15773 photographs were acquired with small uncrewed aerial system (sUAS). The final dataset was produced using structure-from-motion (SfM) processing of derived aerial photographs with georeferencing primarily from dGNSS onboard the sUAS. Vertical root-mean-square-error (RMSe) of the DSM is 0.040 m based on 155 checkpoints measured with dGNSS and horizontal RMSe is estimated to be 0.023 m based on 28 checkpoints that incorporated markers visible in aerial photographs. Motivations to produce this open dataset include: the high earthquake hazard posed by the SSAF, the broad scientific interest in the area, the excellent ability to resolve the ground surface with SfM techniques due to the very sparse vegetation, and the complement to the existing B4 lidar data collected in 2005. This work also serves as a test-run for rapid response to a future surface-rupturing event, including the potential for repeat surveys to capture afterslip. Use of the dataset should be acknowledged with authorship information and the DOI (see citation section below). For additional information, please contact Michael Bunds (michael.bunds@uvu.edu).""" ;

A few examples include Gale Watch, Gale Warning, High Surf Advisory, High Wind Watch, Areal Flood Warning, Coastal Flood Watch, Winter Storm Warning, Wind Chill Advisory, Frost Advisory, Tropical Storm Watch, Red Flag Warning, Air Stagnation Warning, and Beach Hazards Statement. (A complete list is given in the Background Information section below.) The coverage areas of these products are usually defined by county or sub-county boundaries. The colors used to identify the different watches, advisories, warnings, and statements are the same colors used by the NWS on their map at weather.gov.

However, a set of equivalent layers containing the\r\noriginal individual zone geometries are also included for querying purposes,\r\nand are indicated with the suffix &quot;(Zone Polygons)&quot;. Corresponding zone polygon\r\nand dissolved polygon layers are matched together in group layers for each WWA\r\ncategory. The zone polygon layers are included in this service only to support\r\nquery/identify operations (e.g., in order to retrieve the original zone\r\ngeometry or other attributes such as a URL to the warning text bulletin) and\r\nthus will not be drawn when included in a normal map image request. Thus, the\r\ndissolved polygon layers should be used when requesting a map image (e.g. WMS\r\nGetMap or ArcGIS REST export operations), while the zone polygon layers should\r\nbe used when performing a query (e.g. WMS GetFeatureInfo or ArcGIS REST query\r\nor identify operations).\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe colors used to identify the different watches, advisories, warnings, and\r\nstatements are the same colors used by the NWS on their map at\r\n<a href='http://www.weather.gov' target='_blank'>http://www.weather.gov</a>.\r\nThe NWS products for long-duration hazardous conditions are updated in the\r\nnowCOAST\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 map service approximately every 10 minutes.\r\nFor more detailed information about layer update frequency and timing, please reference the  \r\n<a href='//nowcoast.noaa.gov/help/#!section=updateschedule' target='_blank'>nowCOAST\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 Dataset Update Schedule</a>.\r\n</p> \r\n\r\nBackground Information\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNWS watches depict the geographic areas where the risk of hazardous weather or\r\nhydrologic events has increased significantly, but their occurrence, location,\r\nand/or timing is still uncertain. A warning depicts where a hazardous weather\r\nor hydrologic event is occurring, is imminent, or has a very high probability\r\nof occurring. A warning is used for conditions posing a threat to life or\r\nproperty. Advisories indicate where special weather conditions are occurring,\r\nimminent, or have a very high probability of occurring but are less serious\r\nthan a warning. They are for events that may cause significant inconvenience,\r\nand if caution is not exercised, could lead to situations that may threaten\r\nlife and/or property. Statements usually contain updated information on a\r\nwarning and are used to let the public know when a warning is no longer in\r\neffect. NWS issues over 75 different types of watches, warnings, and advisories\r\n(WWAs). WWAs are issued by the NWS regional Weather Forecast Offices (WFOs) and\r\nalso the NWS Ocean Prediction Center, National Hurricane Center, Central\r\nPacific Hurricane Center, and Storm Prediction Center.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe NWS WWAs are organized on the nowCOAST\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 map viewer and within this\r\nmap service by hazardous condition/threat layer groups and then by the\r\ngeographic area (i.e. coastal &amp; inland, immediate coast or maritime) for\r\nwhich the WWA product is targeted. This was done to allow users to select WWAs\r\nfor hazardous conditions that are important to their operations or activities.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nPlease note that the Tropical Storm and Hurricane Warnings are provided in both\r\nthe High Wind Hazards: Maritime Areas and Coastal &amp; Inland Areas layer\r\ngroups and the Flooding Hazards: Coastal Areas layer group. These warnings are\r\nincluded in the Flooding Hazards/Coastal Areas layer group because the NWS uses\r\nthose warnings to inform the public that tropical storm or hurricane winds may\r\nbe accompanied by significant coastal flooding but below the thresholds\r\nrequired for the issuance of a storm surge warning. In addition, a tropical\r\nstorm or hurricane warning may remain in effect when dangerously high water or\r\na combination of dangerously high water and waves continue, even though the\r\nwinds may be less than hurricane or tropical storm force. The NWS does not\r\nissue a Coastal Flood Warning or Advisory when a tropical storm or hurricane\r\nwarning is in effect; however that does not mean that there is not a\r\nsignificant coastal flooding threat.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>\r\n    High Wind Hazards (Associated with Non-Tropical &amp;

If the time parameter is specified in a request, the data or imagery\r\nmost relevant to the provided time value, if any, will be returned. If the time\r\nparameter is not specified in a request, the latest data or imagery valid for\r\nthe present system time will be returned to the client. If the time parameter\r\nis not specified and no data or imagery is available for the present time, no\r\ndata will be returned.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis service is configured with time coverage support, meaning that the service\r\nwill always return the most relevant available data, if any, to the specified\r\ntime value. For example, if the service contains data valid today at 12:00 and\r\n12:10 UTC, but a map request specifies a time value of today at 12:07 UTC, the\r\ndata valid at 12:10 UTC will be returned to the user. This behavior allows more\r\nflexibility for users, especially when displaying multiple time-enabled layers\r\ntogether despite slight differences in temporal resolution or update frequency.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen interacting with this time-enabled service, only a single instantaneous\r\ntime value should be specified in each request. If instead a time range is\r\nspecified in a request (i.e. separate start time and end time values are\r\ngiven), the data returned may be different than what was intended.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nCare must be taken to ensure the time value specified in each request falls\r\nwithin the current time coverage of the service. Because this service is\r\nfrequently updated as new data becomes available, the user must periodically\r\ndetermine the service's time extent. However, due to software limitations, the\r\ntime extent of the service and map layers as advertised by ArcGIS Server does\r\nnot always provide the most up-to-date start and end times of available data.\r\nInstead, users have three options for determining the latest time extent of the\r\nservice:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tIssue a returnUpdates=true request (ArcGIS REST protocol only)\r\n\t\tfor an individual layer or for the service itself, which will return\r\n\t\tthe current start and end times of available data, in epoch time format\r\n\t\t(milliseconds since 00:00 January 1, 1970). To see an example, click on\r\n\t\tthe &quot;Return Updates&quot; link at the bottom of the REST Service page under\r\n\t\t&quot;Supported Operations&quot;. Refer to the\r\n\t\t<a href='http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/arcgis-rest-api/index.html#//02r3000000w2000000' target='_blank'>ArcGIS REST API Map Service Documentation</a>\r\n\t\tfor more information.\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tIssue an Identify (ArcGIS REST) or GetFeatureInfo (WMS) request against\r\n\t\tthe proper layer corresponding with the target dataset. For raster\r\n\t\tdata, this would be the &quot;Image Footprints with Time Attributes&quot; layer\r\n\t\tin the same group as the target &quot;Image&quot; layer being displayed.

        :description """This contribution comprises georeferenced, high-resolution topography and orthomosaics of part of the Lost River fault zone (LFRZ), Idaho, USA, which ruptured in the Mw 6.9 1983 Borah Peak Earthquake. The data set covers ~6.1 km of surface rupture on the LRFZ at and near Doublespring Pass Road. Point clouds and digital surface models (DSMs) were generated from low-altitude aerial photographs using Structure-from-Motion and multi-view stereo processing. The Lost River fault zone (LRFZ) is a range-bounding, west-dipping normal fault in the northern Basin and Range province. The Mw 6.9 1983 Borah Peak earthquake occurred on it and created surface rupture along the southern portion of the Warm Spring section and the entire Thousand Springs section of the fault (Crone et al., 1987; DuRoss et al., 2019). Doublespring Pass Road (DSP) crosses the fault near the center of the Thousand Springs section. At DSP the surface rupture is well exposed and preserved, and it is very easily accessed. To the north of DSP, the surface rupture trends into a salient of limestone and complexly bifurcates into multiple strands (\u00c2\u0091West Spring Block\u00c2\u0092 of Crone et al., 1987). North of the salient, at a site informally named Poison Spring (PS; West Spring in Crone et al., 1987), the surface rupture becomes localized again, with most displacement concentrated onto a single strand. Paleoseismic investigations have been conducted near both DSP (Hait and Scott, 1978; Schwartz and Crone, 1985) and PS (Vincent, 1995). The target sites of the data presented here were the surface rupture at DSP and PS.""" ;

Thus, the\r\ndissolved polygon layers should be used when requesting a map image (e.g. WMS\r\nGetMap or ArcGIS REST export operations), while the zone polygon layers should\r\nbe used when performing a query (e.g. WMS GetFeatureInfo or ArcGIS REST query\r\nor identify operations).\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe colors used to identify the different watches, advisories, warnings, and\r\nstatements are the same colors used by the NWS on their map at\r\n<a href='http://www.weather.gov' target='_blank'>http://www.weather.gov</a>.\r\nThe NWS products for long-duration hazardous conditions are updated in the\r\nnowCOAST\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 map service approximately every 10 minutes.\r\nFor more detailed information about layer update frequency and timing, please reference the  \r\n<a href='//nowcoast.noaa.gov/help/#!section=updateschedule' target='_blank'>nowCOAST\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 Dataset Update Schedule</a>.\r\n</p> \r\n\r\nBackground Information\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNWS watches depict the geographic areas where the risk of hazardous weather or\r\nhydrologic events has increased significantly, but their occurrence, location,\r\nand/or timing is still uncertain. A warning depicts where a hazardous weather\r\nor hydrologic event is occurring, is imminent, or has a very high probability\r\nof occurring. A warning is used for conditions posing a threat to life or\r\nproperty. Advisories indicate where special weather conditions are occurring,\r\nimminent, or have a very high probability of occurring but are less serious\r\nthan a warning. They are for events that may cause significant inconvenience,\r\nand if caution is not exercised, could lead to situations that may threaten\r\nlife and/or property. Statements usually contain updated information on a\r\nwarning and are used to let the public know when a warning is no longer in\r\neffect. NWS issues over 75 different types of watches, warnings, and advisories\r\n(WWAs). WWAs are issued by the NWS regional Weather Forecast Offices (WFOs) and\r\nalso the NWS Ocean Prediction Center, National Hurricane Center, Central\r\nPacific Hurricane Center, and Storm Prediction Center.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe NWS WWAs are organized on the nowCOAST\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 map viewer and within this\r\nmap service by hazardous condition/threat layer groups and then by the\r\ngeographic area (i.e. coastal &amp; inland, immediate coast or maritime) for\r\nwhich the WWA product is targeted. This was done to allow users to select WWAs\r\nfor hazardous conditions that are important to their operations or activities.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nPlease note that the Tropical Storm and Hurricane Warnings are provided in both\r\nthe High Wind Hazards: Maritime Areas and Coastal &amp; Inland Areas layer\r\ngroups and the Flooding Hazards: Coastal Areas layer group. These warnings are\r\nincluded in the Flooding Hazards/Coastal Areas layer group because the NWS uses\r\nthose warnings to inform the public that tropical storm or hurricane winds may\r\nbe accompanied by significant coastal flooding but below the thresholds\r\nrequired for the issuance of a storm surge warning. In addition, a tropical\r\nstorm or hurricane warning may remain in effect when dangerously high water or\r\na combination of dangerously high water and waves continue, even though the\r\nwinds may be less than hurricane or tropical storm force. The NWS does not\r\nissue a Coastal Flood Warning or Advisory when a tropical storm or hurricane\r\nwarning is in effect; however that does not mean that there is not a\r\nsignificant coastal flooding threat.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>\r\n    High Wind Hazards (Associated with Non-Tropical &amp;

If the time parameter is specified in a request, the data or imagery\r\nmost relevant to the provided time value, if any, will be returned. If the time\r\nparameter is not specified in a request, the latest data or imagery valid for\r\nthe present system time will be returned to the client. If the time parameter\r\nis not specified and no data or imagery is available for the present time, no\r\ndata will be returned.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis service is configured with time coverage support, meaning that the service\r\nwill always return the most relevant available data, if any, to the specified\r\ntime value. For example, if the service contains data valid today at 12:00 and\r\n12:10 UTC, but a map request specifies a time value of today at 12:07 UTC, the\r\ndata valid at 12:10 UTC will be returned to the user. This behavior allows more\r\nflexibility for users, especially when displaying multiple time-enabled layers\r\ntogether despite slight differences in temporal resolution or update frequency.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen interacting with this time-enabled service, only a single instantaneous\r\ntime value should be specified in each request. If instead a time range is\r\nspecified in a request (i.e. separate start time and end time values are\r\ngiven), the data returned may be different than what was intended.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nCare must be taken to ensure the time value specified in each request falls\r\nwithin the current time coverage of the service. Because this service is\r\nfrequently updated as new data becomes available, the user must periodically\r\ndetermine the service's time extent. However, due to software limitations, the\r\ntime extent of the service and map layers as advertised by ArcGIS Server does\r\nnot always provide the most up-to-date start and end times of available data.\r\nInstead, users have three options for determining the latest time extent of the\r\nservice:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tIssue a returnUpdates=true request (ArcGIS REST protocol only)\r\n\t\tfor an individual layer or for the service itself, which will return\r\n\t\tthe current start and end times of available data, in epoch time format\r\n\t\t(milliseconds since 00:00 January 1, 1970). To see an example, click on\r\n\t\tthe &quot;Return Updates&quot; link at the bottom of the REST Service page under\r\n\t\t&quot;Supported Operations&quot;. Refer to the\r\n\t\t<a href='http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/arcgis-rest-api/index.html#//02r3000000w2000000' target='_blank'>ArcGIS REST API Map Service Documentation</a>\r\n\t\tfor more information.\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tIssue an Identify (ArcGIS REST) or GetFeatureInfo (WMS) request against\r\n\t\tthe proper layer corresponding with the target dataset. For raster\r\n\t\tdata, this would be the &quot;Image Footprints with Time Attributes&quot; layer\r\n\t\tin the same group as the target &quot;Image&quot; layer being displayed. For\r\n\t\tvector (point, line, or polygon) data, the target layer can be queried\r\n\t\tdirectly. In either case, the attributes returned for the matching\r\n\t\traster(s) or vector feature(s) will include the following:\r\n\t\t<ul>\r\n\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\tvalidtime: Valid timestamp.\r\n\t\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\tstarttime: Display start time.\r\n\t\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\tendtime: Display end time.\r\n\t\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\treftime: Reference time (sometimes referred to as\r\n\t\t\t\tissuance time, cycle time, or initialization time).\r\n\t\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\tprojmins: Number of minutes from reference time to valid\r\n\t\t\t\ttime.\r\n\t\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\tdesigreftime: Designated reference time; used as a\r\n\t\t\t\tcommon reference time for all items when individual reference\r\n\t\t\t\ttimes do not match.\r\n\t\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\tdesigprojmins: Number of minutes from designated\r\n\t\t\t\treference time to valid time.\r\n\t\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tQuery the nowCOAST\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 LayerInfo web service, which has been created to\r\n\t\tprovide additional information about each data layer in a service,\r\n\t\tincluding a list of all available &quot;time stops&quot; (i.e. &quot;valid times&quot;),\r\n\t\tindividual timestamps, or the valid time of a layer's latest available\r\n\t\tdata (i.e. &quot;Product Time&quot;).

The data were delivered in ASCII format (files separated by vegetation points and ground points) with information on X, Y, elevation, Return number, RGB and scan angle. The primary goal of the study is to provide operational implementation of Lidar technology in support of project level planning. The proposed applications of Lidar in support of planning are: vegetation structural modeling, erosion modeling, fuels, transportation planning, timber system planning, wildlife habitat modeling, and stream quality. The Rocky Mountain Research Station will provide the development of peer-reviewed forest structural metrics and technical support in implementation of Lidar technology. The technical specifications have been defined to specifically support vegetation modeling using Lidar data. The project area consists of one contiguous blocks totaling 13234 hectares in Emerald Creek, St. Joe National Forest, Idaho. The project area consists of moderately variable topographic configurations with diverse vegetation components.""" ;

The images were processed using the LPS module of the ERDAS Imagine 2013 software (version 13.00.00, Build 281). A pixel-by-pixel matching procedure was implemented with a window size of 5-by-5 pixels and a correlation coefficient of 0.3 to 0.7. The point cloud covers an approximately 45 km long section of the epicentral area of the 2010 El Mayor-Cucapah earthquake in Mexico. Vertical displacements were determined by differencing the Pleiades topography and the pre-earthquake LiDAR DEM. For further details see: Zhou, Y., B. Parsons, J. R. Elliott, I. Barisin, and R. T.

Measurements in plots of the Forest Inventory and Analysis program (FIA) were used to obtain plot-level ground observations for predictive modeling. Tree and transect measurements in FIA plots were respectively used to obtain plot-level values of AGB and DWB. To obtain plot-level values of CBD, CH, CBH and CFL, tree measurements in FIA plots were processed with FuelCalc. Plot level auxiliary variables were obtained intersecting the axiliary information layers with the FIA plots. Predictive models were random forest models in which a parametric component was added to model the error variance. The error variance was modeled as a power function of the predictive value and was used to produce uncertainty maps. A different model was fit for each variable and the resulting models were used to obtain maps of synthetic predictions for all areas covered by the 20 lidar acquisitions. The modeled error variance was used to generate uncertainty maps for the predictions of each response variable. Model accuracy was assessed globally (for the entire dataset) and separately for each one of the 20 lidar acquisitions included in the dataset. \r\n\r\nResults from the accuracy assessment can be found in Appendix A and Appendix B of Mauro et al. (2021). \r\n\r\n</SPAN></P><P><SPAN>Each variable has two associated maps.

The second one, forest_mask.tif provides a forest vs non-forest mask. Forested areas are coded as 1s and non-forested areas with no-datas. This mask is a resampled subset of the PALSAR JAXA 2014 \u00e2\u0080\u0098New global 25m-resolution PALSAR mosaic and forest/non-forest map (2007-2010) - version 1\u00e2\u0080\u0099 from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency Earth Observation Research Center (www.eorc.jaxa.jp/ALOS/en/palsar_fnf/fnf_index.htm). Its reference year is 2009. Models to predict forest attributes were created using ground observations in forested areas. For many applications it is advisable to use the provided mask to excluded non-forested areas from analyses. This can be done, for example, multiplying the desired raster by the forest mask. Exceptions to this may occur in relatively open forested lands where the mask eliminates areas that actually sustain forest. In those areas, the use of an add-hoc forest mask might be more appropriate. \r\n\r\n### Reference year: \r\nyear.tif\r\n\r\n### Forest mask: \r\nforest_mask.tif\r\n\r\n\r\n### <P><SPAN STYLE=\"font-weight:bold;\">UNITS:</SPAN></P>\r\n\r\n<P><SPAN>For a given variable, both predictions and standard deviation of model errors have the same units.

The data were created using small UAS-derived low-altitude aerial photographs, Structure-from-Motion processing, and georeferencing from dGNSS onboard the sUAS and ground control points. The motivation for producing the data set was to difference the topography against EarthScope lidar of the area collected ten years earlier, in 2007, to measure strain along and across strike of the fault (Scott et al., 2020). The study site was chosen because it is the location of a previous paleoseismology study (Toke et al., 2015), and creep-induced fracturing was mapped in detail at the location in 2014 and used to infer deformation rate localized on the fault (Scott et al., 2020).

The Mw 6.9 1983 Borah Peak earthquake occurred on it and created surface rupture along the southern portion of the Warm Spring section and the entire Thousand Springs section of the fault (Crone et al., 1987; DuRoss et al., 2019). The Warm Spring and Thousand Springs sections are separated by the Willow Creek Hills, which form a structural boundary. We used unoccupied aerial systems (UAS) and a tethered \"helikite\" balloon to acquire aerial photographs, which were combined with ground control georeferencing to create two point clouds that model the topography at high resolution (< 10 cm) along the northern ~16 km of surface rupture. One point cloud covers the southern ~9 km of the Warm Spring Section and a second point cloud covers the northern ~7 km of the Thousand Springs Section. DSMs were generated from the point clouds, and orthomosaics of each area were made from the aerial photographs. The primary motivation for acquisition of the data set was study of the surface offset across the Willow Creek Hills structural boundary from the 1983 earthquake and prehistoric surface-rupturing events (DuRoss et al., 2019).

This project is the data acquisition phase of a administrative study being done in collaboration with the Nez Perce National Forest, Grangeville, ID; Forest Service Region 1 Regional Office, Missoula, MT (Forest Inventory and Analysis and Remote Sensing/ Geospatial Team); and Rocky Mountain Research Station - Forest Sciences Lab, Moscow, ID. The primary goal of the study is to provide operational implementation of Lidar technology in support of project level planning. The proposed applications of Lidar in support of planning are: vegetation structural modeling, erosion modeling, fuels, transportation planning, timber system planning, wildlife habitat modeling, and stream quality. The Rocky Mountain Research Station will provide the development of peer-reviewed forest structural metrics and technical support in implementation of Lidar technology. The technical specifications have been defined to specifically support vegetation modeling using Lidar data. The project area consists of one contiguous blocks totaling 17, 325 hectares in north central Idaho. The project area consists of moderately variable topographic configurations with diverse vegetation components. Clear Creek is a tributary of the Middle Fork Clearwater River located east of Kooskia, Idaho. Vegetation is variable, transitioning from low elevation shrubland and mixed conifers to upper elevation spruce-fir. Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) are the predominant species at lower to mid elevations occupying a fairly xeric setting transitioning to grand fir (Abies grandis) and western red cedar (Thuja plicata) at mid elevations and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) at the higher elevations.""" ;

        :description """DOGAMI has been supervising and coordinating the collection of large swaths of high resolution, high accuracy lidar data in Oregon and adjacent states since 2006. Following a successful 2500 mi2 consortium effort in the Portland urban area, the Oregon legislature designated DOGAMI as the lead agency for lidar acquisition in Oregon. DOGAMI used a nationwide selection process that resulted in a state price agreement (OPA 8865) with Watershed Sciences Inc. of Corvallis, Oregon. The price agreement specifies data collection (8 pulse/m2, Zerror < 12cm RMSE) and product standards (LAS points, 3ft or 1m bare earth and highest hit DEMs, 1.5ft intensity images, metadata) with a pre-determined unit cost to DOGAMI based on the size of the project area. Since developing OPA 8865 in April 2008, DOGAMI has ordered 13 large lidar flights, totaling 17,500 mi2, has taken final delivery of 16,000 mi2 of data. Funding for these projects has come from consortia organized by DOGAMI that include several dozen Federal, State and local government agencies, non-profits and public utilities. The data quality for all projects that DOGAMI has completed under OPA 8865 has been consistently excellent, substantially exceeding the minimum specifications. All DOGAMI lidar data is in the public domain, please reference DOGAMI as the data source. All DOGAMI lidar program data are systematically evaluated for: Completeness and useability by loading all files; swath to swath consistency by using TerraMatch to compare elevations of millions of coincident points from adjacent swaths, all values to date < 5cm; absolute vertical accuracy by comparing delivered DEMs to an large independent set of RTK GPS control points collected by DOGAMI, all values to date < 7cm RMSE; grid artifacts by visual examination of hillshade and slopeshade images of all bare earth and highest hit DEMs.""" ;

The eastern polygon (Legg) covers the Kautz Creek watershed and was collected to investigate landscape response to debris flows in order to implicate hazards in Mt. Rainier National Park. The western polygon (Anderson) covers the Tahoma Creek watershed and was collected to assess climatically-driven aggradation in a mountain stream. The total area for the combined survey including the area between the requested polygons and the additional coverage in the northwest corner is approximately 123 square kilometers.

Each bridge was captured as a point which was placed in the center of the &quot;main span&quot; (highest and longest span). For bridges that cross navigable waterways, this was typically the part of the bridge over the navigation channel. If no &quot;main span&quot; was discernable using the imagery sources available, or if multiple non contiguous main spans were discernable, the point was placed in the center of the overall structure. Bridges that are sourced from the National Bridge Inventory (NBI) that cross state boundaries are an exception. Bridges that cross state boundaries are represented in the NBI by two records. The points for the two records have been located so as to be within the state indicated by the NBI's [STATE_CODE] attribute. In some cases, following these rules did not place the point at the location at which the bridge crosses what the user may judge as the most important feature intersected. For example, a given bridge may be many miles long, crossing nothing more than low lying ground for most of its length but crossing a major interstate at its far end. Due to the fact that bridges are often high narrow structures crossing depressions that may or may not be too narrow to be represented in the DEM used to orthorectify a given source of imagery, alignment with ortho imagery is highly variable. In particular, apparent bridge location in ortho imagery is highly dependent on collection angle. During verification, TechniGraphics used imagery from the following sources: NGA HSIP 133 City, State or Local; NAIP; DOQQ imagery. In cases where &quot;bridge sway&quot; or &quot;tall structure lean&quot; was evident, TGS attempted to compensate for these factors when capturing the bridge location. For instances in which the bridge was not visible in imagery, it was captured using topographic maps at the intersection of the water and rail line. TGS processed 784 entities previously with the HSIP Bridges-Roads (STRAHNET Option - HSIP 133 Cities and Gulf Coast). These entities were added into this dataset after processing. No entities were included in this dataset for American Samoa, Guam, Hawaii, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or the Virgin Islands because there are no main line railways in these areas. At the request of NGA, text fields in this dataset have been set to all upper case to facilitate consistent database engine search results. At the request of NGA, leading and trailing spaces were trimmed from all text fields. At the request of NGA, all diacritics (e.g., the German umlaut or the Spanish tilde) have been replaced with their closest equivalent English character to facilitate use with database systems that may not support diacritics. The currentness of this dataset is given by the publication date which is 09/02/2009. A more precise measure of currentness cannot be provided since this is dependent on the NBI and the source of imagery used during processing.</span></font>""" ;

We used multitemporal airborne laser scanning (ALS), combined with field data, to empirically model these variables at fine scales (5 m resolution). We acquired Fuel Characteristic Classification System (FCCS) estimates of fuel load through LANDFIRE (30 m resolution) and estimated fuel consumption using CONSUME in the software program Fuel and Fire Tools (FFT). This data publication contains pre/post fire fuel load and fuel consumption for the 2018 Tepee Fire (Oregon, USA) using each of the ALS and FCCS approaches. We used these data to compare the approaches and to examine the effect of differing spatial resolution. The data may also be used for studying fire behavior, fire effects, and smoke emissions at these fires. Further detail on these data can be found in McCarley et al. 2022.\r\n\r\n### Units\r\nThe units for all fuel estimates are megagrams per hectare.

Lidar data from the Nyack Floodplain on the Middle Fork of the Flathead River was collected for several purposes. The first was to provide a base image from which we could place a network of groundwater wells. The data was also used combination with optical remotes sensing data, both airborne and satellite, to identify pixels within multispectral optical imagery that corresponded to various vegetation height elevations. Those pixels were then separately classified by vegetation type. Data was also used to conduct simple flood inundation modeling of the floodplain and in combination with measures of flow depth and velocity extracting water surface elevation from the lidar to map the spatial distribution of stream power. This area has a repeat survey from Spetember 2005: Flathead Lake Biological Station, MT (September 2005).""" ;

As of 2014, the monetary requirement was dropped and the damage requirement is 3 or more habitable structures or commercial structures.</p><p style='margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.7rem; box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Source Sans Pro&quot;, sans-serif;'>In 1989, CAL FIRE units were requested to fill in gaps in their fire perimeter data as part of the California Fire Plan. FRAP provided each unit with a preliminary map of 1950-89 fire perimeters. Unit personnel also verified the pre-1989 perimeter maps to determine if any fires were missing or should be re-mapped. Each CAL FIRE Unit then generated a list of 300+ acre fires that started since 1989 using the CAL FIRE Emergency Activity Reporting System (EARS). The CAL FIRE personnel used this list to gather post-1989 perimeter maps for digitizing. The final product is a statewide GIS layer spanning the period 1950-1999.</p><p style='margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.7rem; box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Source Sans Pro&quot;, sans-serif;'>CAL FIRE has completed inventory for the majority of its historical perimeters back to 1950.

Dolan, PI, University of Southern California). This project was a collaborative effort between PI Dolan (USC) and co-I Ed Rhodes (UCLA) and New Zealand collaborators Russ Van Dissen and Rob Langridge of GNS Science. The survey area consists of a total of 254 km of fault-parallel, predominantly ~1.2-km-wide swaths along parts of the four main right-lateral strike-slip faults that comprise the Marlborough Fault System, in the northwestern portion of New Zealand's South Island. The five fault segments surveyed include sections of the eastern and western parts of the Clarence fault, the central part of the Awatere fault, the central part of the Wairau fault, and part of the eastern (Conway) segment of the Hope fault. These lidar data facilitated detailed analysis of fault offsets along the four main MFS faults, as well as mapping of small displacements that have occurred in recent earthquakes on Marlborough faults in unprecedented detail, the geomorphic development and evolution of fluvial terraces crossing these faults, and the progressive geomorphic manifestation of off-fault deformation with increasing fault displacement. The data were analyzed by the PIs, our New Zealand collaborators, and three graduate students at USC (Robert Zinke, Alexandra Hatem, and Jessica Grenader), and one graduate student at UCLA (Chris McGuire [supervised by Co-I Ed Rhodes]); their results will form major parts of their graduate theses. The lidar data were collected by U.S. National Center for Airborne Laser Mapping (NCALM) personnel using an aircraft and flight personnel subcontracted from New Zealand Aerial Mapping. The data were collected with a combination of NCALM's Optech GEMINI sensor (operated at a laser pulse frequency of 125 kHz in multi-pulse mode, at a nominal height above ground of 1400 m) and NZAM's Optech 3100A sensor (operated at a laser pulse frequency of 70-100 kHz at various heights depending on terrain). Shot density is \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 12 shots/m2. The lidar data were utilized in our studies of the incremental slip-rate record of the four main Marlborough faults. The lidar data also provided a means of mapping small displacements that have occurred in recent earthquakes on Marlborough faults in unprecedented detail, the sedimentological development and geomorphic evolution of fluvial terraces crossing these faults, and the progressive geomorphic manifestation of off-fault deformation with increasing fault displacement (see Zinke et al., 2015 Geology for a discussion of this latter topic [doi:10.1130/G37065.1]).""" ;

Data collection covers and area of ~69 km2 along the Mission River in Refugio, Texas after Hurricane Harvey. Note: this project utilized three laser channels during its data collection. Each of the returns contained on the LAS tiles are encoded with a laser channel value. The values used are 1 (1550 nm), 2 (1064 nm), and 3 (532 nm), and are stored in the \"User Data\" record of the Point Data records in the LAS file. This data collection also contains hyperspectral images that are 72 Band, 1.5 m pixel size, in PCIDSK (.PIX) format. The digital number in the PIX image corresponds to milli-SRU (spectral radiance units). One SRU is equivalent to one microwatt per square-centimeter per steradian per nanometer. Files are provided as individual flight strips as well as a single mosaic file of flight strips. These images can be downloaded here The pre-computed Raster products are split into two separate landing pages: C1-2, and C1-2-3. Pre-computed Raster C1-2 contains the following: DEM from classified ground returns from Channels 1 and 2 (IR only) DSM from first return from Channels 1 and 2 Pre-computed Raster C1-2-3 contains the following: DEM from classified ground and bathymetry returns from all channels DSM from first returns from all channels (C1C2C3) Water surface grid from point class 39 Bathymetry grid from point class 9""" ;

Access to localized weather conditions benefit both commercial and General Aviation (GA) operations. Caltrans Division of Aeronautics (Division) is monitoring the expansion and updating of the system with a focus on bringing more of this technology to key airports thereby improving air safety. Also, as AWOS/ASOS technology improves, the use of the hardware for shared uses, such as monitoring remote highways concurrently with remote airports is seen as an essential safety measure for normal as well as emergency response operations. The State is currently researching a cooperative approach to improving the road and aviation automated weather reporting system to support multimodal safety statewide.

        :description """The New Madrid Seismic Zone (NMSZ) has been responsible for producing some of the largest intraplate earthquakes on record (Tuttle et al., 2002). Paleoseismologic studies of sand blows and the Reelfoot fault show that earthquakes occurred in the last 4000 years at intervals of approximately 400-600 years (Kelson et al., 1995; Tuttle et al., 2002; Holbrook et al., 2006). The 1811-1812 NMSZ sequence produced three major earthquakes (M 7-8) followed by several large aftershocks and hundreds of smaller ones, resulting in a felt area that reached the east coast of the United States and caused destruction of several settlements along the Mississippi River due to liquefaction and strong shaking (Nuttli 1973, Johnston and Schweig, 1996). The risk of another large destructive earthquake in this region is of great concern to the USGS and local and federal authorities because several large metropolitan areas (Memphis, Little Rock, Nashville, St. Louis), and hundreds of smaller communities lie in or near the NMSZ. The mechanism for occurrence of earthquakes in the NMSZ is widely debated. Studies reveal the NMSZ is underlain by a failed rifting event, dating from late Precambrian. During the failed rifting event, emplacement of mafic plutons throughout the crustal column took place. Further studies show a correlation between the rift and current seismic activity. This correlation suggests that the source of the earthquakes was from slippage along weak zones within the failed rift caused by the E-W compressive stress of the region, a result of plate motion. Seismic monitoring shows that there is a spatial correlation of the active seismic zone with the failed Reelfoot Rift.""" ;

The site was chosen for the well-developed and preserved scarp, shorelines, and cross-cutting relationships in the area. UAS \u00c2\u0096 derived low-altitude aerial photographs and dGNSS \u00c2\u0096 measured ground control points were processed with Structure-from-Motion and multi-view stereo software (SfM) to generate a point cloud, digital surface model (DSM), and orthomosaic, of the area. The House Range fault (HRF) is a range-bounding, west-dipping normal fault in the western Sevier Desert, within the eastern Basin and Range province, Utah, USA. There is up to 1600 m of vertical relief across the fault, and it displays characteristics typical of tectonically \u00c2\u0096 driven extensional faulting, in contrast to extension that is associated with volcanism in the eastern Sevier Desert (Stahl and Niemi, 2017; Stahl et al., in review).""" ;

FRA lands are snapped to county parcel data, thus federal ownership areas will also be snapped. Since SRA Fees were first implemented in 2011, CAL FIRE has devoted significant resources to improve the quality of SRA data. This includes comparing SRA data to data from other federal, state, and local agencies, an annual comparison to county assessor roll files, and a formal SRA review process that includes input from CAL FIRE Units. As a result, FRA lands provide a solid basis as the footprint for federal lands in California (except in the southeastern desert area). The methodology for federal lands involves:\u00c2\u00a0</font><div><font size='4'>1) snapping federal data sources to parcels;\u00c2\u00a0</font></div><div><font size='4'>2) clipping to the FRA footprint;\u00c2\u00a0</font></div><div><font size='4'>3) overlaying the federal data sources and using a hierarchy when sources overlap to resolve coding issues (BIA, UFW, NPS, USF, BLM, DOD, ACE, BOR);\u00c2\u00a0</font></div><div><font size='4'>4) utilizing an automated process to merge \u00e2\u0080\u009cunknown\u00e2\u0080\u009d FRA slivers with appropriate adjacent ownerships;</font></div><div><font size='4'>5) a manual review of FRA areas not assigned a federal agency by this process.\u00c2\u00a0</font></div><div><font size='4'><br /></font></div><div><font size='4'>Non-Federal ownership information was obtained from the California Protected Areas Database (CPAD), was clipped to the non-FRA area, and an automated process was used to fill in some sliver-gaps that occurred between the federal and non-federal data. Southeastern Desert Area: CAL FIRE does not devote the same level of resources for maintaining SRA data in this region of the state, since we have no fire protection responsibility. This includes almost all of Imperial County, and the desert portions of Riverside, and San Bernardino Counties. In these areas, we used federal protection areas from the current version of the Direct Protection Areas (DPA) dataset. Due to the fact that there were draw-issues with the previous version of ownership, this version does NOT fill in the areas that are not assigned to one of the owner groups (it does not cover all lands in the state). Also unlike previous versions of the dataset, this version only defines ownership down to the agency level - it does not contain more specific property information (for example, which National Forest). The option for a more detailed future release remains, however, and due to the use of automated tools, could always be created without much additional effort.This dataset includes a representation to symbolize based on the Own_Group field using the standard color scheme utilized on DPA maps.For more details about data inputs, see the Lineage section of the metadata. For detailed notes on previous versions, see the Supplemental Information section of the metadata.</font></div><div><font size='4'><br /></font></div><div><font size='4'>This ownership dataset is derived from CAL FIRE's SRA dataset, and GreenInfo Network's California Protected Areas Database. CAL FIRE tracks lands owned by federal agencies as part of our efforts to maintain fire protection responsibility boundaries, captured as part of our State Responsiblity Areas (SRA) dataset. This effort draws on data provided by various federal agencies including USDA Forest Service, BLM, National Park Service, US Fish and Wildlife Service, and Bureau of Inidan Affairs. Since SRA lands are matched to county parcel data where appropriate, often federal land boundaries are also adjusted to match parcels, and may not always exactly match the source federal data. Federal lands from the SRA dataset are combined with ownership data for non-federal lands from CPAD, in order to capture lands owned by various state and local agencies, special districts, and conservation organizations. Data from CPAD are imported directly and not adjusted to match parcels or other features. However, CPAD features may be trimmed if they overlap federal lands from the SRA dataset. Areas without an ownership feature are ASSUMED to be private (but not included in the dataset as such).\u00c2\u00a0</font></div><div><font size='4'><br /></font></div><div><font size='4'>This service represents the latest release of the dataset by FRAP, and is updated twice a year when new versions are released.\u00c2\u00a0</font></div>""" ;

The 3DEP program provides a variety of resolution raster elevation data of the conterminous United States, Alaska, Hawaii, and the island territories. Some of the data sets, such as the 1 arc-second dataset, are derived from diverse source data sets that are processed to a specification with a consistent resolution, coordinate system, elevation units, and horizontal and vertical datums. These seamless DEMs were referred to as the National Elevation Dataset (NED) from about 2000 through 2015 at which time they became the seamless DEM layers under the 3DEP program and the NED name and system were retired. USGS Standard DEMs represent the topographic surface of the earth and contain flattened water surfaces. Each DEM dataset is identified by its horizontal resolution and is produced to a consistent set of specifications. The elevations in these DEMs represent the topographic bare-earth surface. Standard DEMs are characterized either as project-based or seamless. Seamless DEMs (e.g. 1 arc second) are produced by blending only the highest quality project data into a continuous terrain surface for the U.S., and are updated continuously to integrate newly available, improved elevation source data. The 1 arc-second (~30 meter) DEM is a lower resolution seamless dataset providing complete coverage over the conterminous U.S. and partial coverage of Alaska. Most of Canada and Mexico are also covered by the 1 arc-second dataset. Note: Metadata for the different USGS raster products can be found here. All 3DEP products are public domain. For more details about the USGS 3DEP DEMs visit this USGS page.""" ;

The flight was paid for by Trout Unlimited's US Bureau of Reclamation project partner. The majority of surveyed area was to support conservation and restoration efforts by Trout Unlimited and others in the Lemhi Watershed. The 2010 Lemhi River data were integrated with overlapping portions of the 2009 data (Amonson) to provide seamless models. Additionally, two mainstem areas of interest (AOI) along the Lemhi River and five additional 'satellite' AOIs were added to the acquisition by Utah State University to support a study intercomparing different topographic survey and aerial photography acquisition methods. In addition to airborne Lidar, Bangen et al. (2011) used total station, rtkGPS, ground-based Lidar, spectral-based depth correlation and single-beam SONAR to collect topography at all of these AOI's. Aerial orthophotos were collected concurrently with the Watershed Sciences survey, whereas Utah State University acquired comparable imagery by both tethered blimp and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) surveys.

The DEMs were constructed using the open-source software package SETSM (https://mjremotesensing.wordpress.com/setsm/) from DigitalGlobe base imagery (\u00c2\u00a9DigitalGlobe 2018). DEMs were mosaicked and vertically registered using the Ames StereoPipeline (https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/asr/groups/intelligent-robotics/ngt/stereo/). The base imagery included 0.5m and 0.3m resolution panchromatic imagery from QuickBird, GEOEYE, WorldView1, WorldView2, and WorldView3 (\u00c2\u00a9DigitalGlobe 2018). The dataset includes DEMs generated from in-track stereo imagery, as well as DEMs constructed from mixed pairs of non-in-track stereo images. The pre-event DEMs are all vertically registered to the 30 m Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) DEM. The generation of this dataset was funded by NASA in cooperation with the U.S. Geological Survey. A complete description of the generation of this dataset and the images that were used to construct the DEMs can be found in the associated manuscript: Barnhart WD, Gold RD, Shea HN, Peterson KE, Briggs RW, Harbor DJ (2019) Vertical coseismic offsets derived from high-resolution stereogrammetric DSM differencing: The 2013 Baluchistan, Pakistan earthquake, JGR-Solid Earth DOI:10.1029/2018JB017107 The naming convention of individual DEMs is detailed in the metadata. Note: The source data for this project are the individual 2 meter DEMs that were constructed with the SETSM open-source software (described above). However, in order to utilize the OpenTopography webmap interface, these DEMs were mosaiced into a single seamless mosaic of pre-earthquake topography. Details on how this single mosaic was created are in the metadata. Users are cautioned that files created using the webmap interface will use the averaged, mosaic data. For certain applications, users may wish to utilize the source datasets by downloading the original DEMs via the \"Source\" directory under the \"Bulk Download\" section of the OpenTopography website.""" ;

Deliverables include LAS 1.2 files (classified and raw), digital elevation model, digital surface model, control data, and metadata. Full waveform data were also collected over the entire project area. Data were collected using a Riegl LMS-Q560 laser scanner flown from a helicopter. Helicopters were also used to establish ground control on all five islands. Personnel from National Park Service and The Natural Conservancy (which owns most of Santa Cruz Island) accompanied the survey team to ensure minimal impact to habitat. To assist with positional accuracy, continuously operating reference stations (CORS) on each island were modified by UNAVCO from a 15 second to a one second sampling rate during the collection period.

Data were provided by the University of Maryland and the Sonoma County Vegetation Mapping and Lidar Program under grant NNX13AP69G from NASA's Carbon Monitoring System (Dr. Ralph Dubayah, PI). The Sonoma County Vegetation Mapping and Lidar Program is NASA/UMD's local partner in this project- its members are as follows: the Sonoma County Agricultural Preservation and Open Space District, the Sonoma County Water Agency, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, the United States Geological Survey, the Sonoma County Information Systems Department, the Sonoma County Transportation and Public Works Department, the Nature Conservancy, and the City of Petaluma. These data will be used for various research projects throughout Sonoma County. They are critical to assessing climate mitigation and adaptation strategies and benefits provided by the landscape, such as the amount of carbon sequestration in forests or the degree to which riparian areas, floodplains, and coastal habitats may buffer extreme weather events. Other research applications include groundwater, ecosystem services valuation, ecosystem resiliency, and wildlife habitat connectivity. Finally, these data sets are key to facilitating good planning and management for watershed protection, flood control, fire and fuels management and wildlife habitat conservation. The data was collected between September 28 and November 26, 2013 by Watershed Sciences, Inc. (WSI). Lidar was collected at high density greater than 8 pulses per square meter. WSI used two airplanes, one carrying a Leica ALS50 and the other a Leica ALS70; systems were flown at 900 meters above ground level, capturing a scan angle of 15 degrees from nadir (30 degree field of view). 4-band, 6-inch resolution aerial photography was collected simultaneously with the Lidar data.""" ;

(A complete list is given in the Background Information section below.) The coverage areas of these products are usually defined by county or sub-county boundaries. The colors used to identify the different watches, advisories, warnings, and statements are the same colors used by the NWS on their map at weather.gov.

However, a set of equivalent layers containing the\noriginal individual zone geometries are also included for querying purposes,\nand are indicated with the suffix &quot;(Zone Polygons)&quot;. Corresponding zone polygon\nand dissolved polygon layers are matched together in group layers for each WWA\ncategory. The zone polygon layers are included in this service only to support\nquery/identify operations (e.g., in order to retrieve the original zone\ngeometry or other attributes such as a URL to the warning text bulletin) and\nthus will not be drawn when included in a normal map image request. Thus, the\ndissolved polygon layers should be used when requesting a map image (e.g. WMS\nGetMap or ArcGIS REST export operations), while the zone polygon layers should\nbe used when performing a query (e.g. WMS GetFeatureInfo or ArcGIS REST query\nor identify operations).\n</p>\n<p>\nThe colors used to identify the different watches, advisories, warnings, and\nstatements are the same colors used by the NWS on their map at\n<a href='http://www.weather.gov' target='_blank'>http://www.weather.gov</a>.\nThe NWS products for long-duration hazardous conditions are updated in the\nnowCOAST\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 map service approximately every 10 minutes.\nFor more detailed information about layer update frequency and timing, please reference the  \n<a href='//nowcoast.noaa.gov/help/#!section=updateschedule' target='_blank'>nowCOAST\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 Dataset Update Schedule</a>.\n</p> \n\nBackground Information\n\n<p>\nNWS watches depict the geographic areas where the risk of hazardous weather or\nhydrologic events has increased significantly, but their occurrence, location,\nand/or timing is still uncertain. A warning depicts where a hazardous weather\nor hydrologic event is occurring, is imminent, or has a very high probability\nof occurring. A warning is used for conditions posing a threat to life or\nproperty. Advisories indicate where special weather conditions are occurring,\nimminent, or have a very high probability of occurring but are less serious\nthan a warning. They are for events that may cause significant inconvenience,\nand if caution is not exercised, could lead to situations that may threaten\nlife and/or property. Statements usually contain updated information on a\nwarning and are used to let the public know when a warning is no longer in\neffect. NWS issues over 75 different types of watches, warnings, and advisories\n(WWAs). WWAs are issued by the NWS regional Weather Forecast Offices (WFOs) and\nalso the NWS Ocean Prediction Center, National Hurricane Center, Central\nPacific Hurricane Center, and Storm Prediction Center.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe NWS WWAs are organized on the nowCOAST\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 map viewer and within this\nmap service by hazardous condition/threat layer groups and then by the\ngeographic area (i.e. coastal &amp; inland, immediate coast or maritime) for\nwhich the WWA product is targeted. This was done to allow users to select WWAs\nfor hazardous conditions that are important to their operations or activities.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nPlease note that the Tropical Storm and Hurricane Warnings are provided in both\nthe High Wind Hazards: Maritime Areas and Coastal &amp; Inland Areas layer\ngroups and the Flooding Hazards: Coastal Areas layer group. These warnings are\nincluded in the Flooding Hazards/Coastal Areas layer group because the NWS uses\nthose warnings to inform the public that tropical storm or hurricane winds may\nbe accompanied by significant coastal flooding but below the thresholds\nrequired for the issuance of a storm surge warning. In addition, a tropical\nstorm or hurricane warning may remain in effect when dangerously high water or\na combination of dangerously high water and waves continue, even though the\nwinds may be less than hurricane or tropical storm force. The NWS does not\nissue a Coastal Flood Warning or Advisory when a tropical storm or hurricane\nwarning is in effect; however that does not mean that there is not a\nsignificant coastal flooding threat.\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    High Wind Hazards (Associated with Non-Tropical &amp;

If the time parameter is specified in a request, the data or imagery\nmost relevant to the provided time value, if any, will be returned. If the time\nparameter is not specified in a request, the latest data or imagery valid for\nthe present system time will be returned to the client. If the time parameter\nis not specified and no data or imagery is available for the present time, no\ndata will be returned.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThis service is configured with time coverage support, meaning that the service\nwill always return the most relevant available data, if any, to the specified\ntime value. For example, if the service contains data valid today at 12:00 and\n12:10 UTC, but a map request specifies a time value of today at 12:07 UTC, the\ndata valid at 12:10 UTC will be returned to the user. This behavior allows more\nflexibility for users, especially when displaying multiple time-enabled layers\ntogether despite slight differences in temporal resolution or update frequency.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen interacting with this time-enabled service, only a single instantaneous\ntime value should be specified in each request. If instead a time range is\nspecified in a request (i.e. separate start time and end time values are\ngiven), the data returned may be different than what was intended.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCare must be taken to ensure the time value specified in each request falls\nwithin the current time coverage of the service. Because this service is\nfrequently updated as new data becomes available, the user must periodically\ndetermine the service's time extent. However, due to software limitations, the\ntime extent of the service and map layers as advertised by ArcGIS Server does\nnot always provide the most up-to-date start and end times of available data.\nInstead, users have three options for determining the latest time extent of the\nservice:\n</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>\n\t\tIssue a returnUpdates=true request (ArcGIS REST protocol only)\n\t\tfor an individual layer or for the service itself, which will return\n\t\tthe current start and end times of available data, in epoch time format\n\t\t(milliseconds since 00:00 January 1, 1970). To see an example, click on\n\t\tthe &quot;Return Updates&quot; link at the bottom of the REST Service page under\n\t\t&quot;Supported Operations&quot;. Refer to the\n\t\t<a href='http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/arcgis-rest-api/index.html#//02r3000000w2000000' target='_blank'>ArcGIS REST API Map Service Documentation</a>\n\t\tfor more information.\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tIssue an Identify (ArcGIS REST) or GetFeatureInfo (WMS) request against\n\t\tthe proper layer corresponding with the target dataset. For raster\n\t\tdata, this would be the &quot;Image Footprints with Time Attributes&quot; layer\n\t\tin the same group as the target &quot;Image&quot; layer being displayed.

An Emergency Operations Center may be a temporary facility or may be located in a more central or permanently established facility, perhaps at a higher level of organization within a jurisdiction. Emergency Operations Centers may be organized by major functional disciplines (e.g., fire, law enforcement, and medical services), by jurisdiction (e.g., Federal, State, regional, county, city, tribal), or some combination thereof.&quot; (Excerpted from the National Incident Management System) The GFI source for this layer contains State and Federal Emergency Operations Centers in addition to local Emergency Operations Centers. This dataset contains these features as well. In cases where an Emergency Operations Center has a mobile unit, TechniGraphics captured the location of the mobile unit as a separate record. This record represents where the mobile unit is stored. If this location could not be verified, a point was placed in the approximate center of the Emergency Operations Centers service area. Effort was made by TechniGraphics to verify whether or not each Emergency Operations Center has a generator on-site and whether or not the Emergency Operations Center is located in a basement. This information is indicated by the values in the [GENERATOR] and [BASEMENT] fields respectively. In cases where more than one record existed for a geographical area (e.g., county, city), TechniGraphics verified whether or not one of the records represented an alternate location. This was indicated by appending &quot;-ALTERNATE&quot; to the value in the [NAME] field. Some Emergency Operations Centers are located at private residences. The [TYPE] field was manually evaluated during the delivery process to compare the records in which the [NAME] field contained &quot;-ALTERNATE&quot;. In cases where these values contradicted information that was verified by TechniGraphics (e.g. [NAME] contained &quot;-ALTERNATE&quot; and [TYPE] = &quot;PRIMARY&quot;), the value in the [TYPE] field was changed to match the type indicated by the [NAME] of the verified record. TechniGraphics did not change values in this field if the type was not verified. Records with &quot;-DOD&quot; appended to the end of the [NAME] value are located on a military base, as defined by the Defense Installation Spatial Data Infrastructure (DISDI) military installations and military range boundaries. &quot;#&quot; and &quot;*&quot; characters were automatically removed from standard HSIP fields that TechniGraphics populated. Double spaces were replaced by single spaces in these same fields. At the request of NGA, text fields in this dataset have been set to all upper case to facilitate consistent database engine search results. At the request of NGA, all diacritics (e.g., the German umlaut or the Spanish tilde) have been replaced with their closest equivalent English character to facilitate use with database systems that may not support diacritics. The currentness of this dataset is indicated by the [CONTDATE] field. Based upon this attribute, the oldest record dates from 08/28/2009 and the newest record dates from 11/18/2009.</span></font><div><span style='font-family: &quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);'><font size='4'><br /></font></span></div><div><span style='font-family: &quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);'><font size='4'>Homeland Security Use Cases: Use cases describe how the data may be used and help to define and clarify requirements. 1.

This project is the data acquisition phase of a administrative study being done in collaboration with the Nez Perce National Forest, Grangeville, ID; Forest Service Region 1 Regional Office, Missoula, MT (Forest Inventory and Analysis and Remote Sensing/ Geospatial Team); and Rocky Mountain Research Station - Forest Sciences Lab, Moscow, ID. The primary goal of the study is to provide operational implementation of Lidar technology in support of project level planning. The proposed applications of Lidar in support of planning are: vegetation structural modeling, erosion modeling, fuels, transportation planning, timber system planning, wildlife habitat modeling, and stream quality. The Rocky Mountain Research Station will provide the development of peer-reviewed forest structural metrics and technical support in implementation of Lidar technology. The technical specifications have been defined to specifically support vegetation modeling using Lidar data. The project area consists of two contiguous blocks totaling 42,889 hectares in north central Idaho. The project area consists of moderately variable topographic configurations with diverse vegetation components. Vegetation is variable, transitioning from low elevation shrubland and mixed conifers to upper elevation spruce-fir. Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) are the predominant species at lower to mid elevations occupying a fairly xeric setting transitioning to grand fir (Abies grandis) and western red cedar (Thuja plicata) at mid elevations and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) at the higher elevations.""" ;

This DEM is a global elevation grid with a spatial sampling interval of 15 arc seconds (approximately 500 x 500 m pixel size at the equator). New data consists of >33.6 million multibeam and singlebeam measurements collated by several institutions, namely, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology, Geoscience Australia, Center for Coastal and Ocean Mapping, and Scripps Institution of Oceanography. New altimetry data consists of 48, 14, and 12 months of retracked range measurements from Cryosat-2, SARAL/AltiKa, and Jason-2, respectively. Onshore, topography data are sourced from previously published digital elevation models, predominately SRTM-CGIAR V4.1 between 60N and 60S. ArcticDEM is used above 60N, while Reference Elevation Model of Antarctica is used below 62S. For more information on this dataset, see its associated publication: Tozer, B, Sandwell, D.

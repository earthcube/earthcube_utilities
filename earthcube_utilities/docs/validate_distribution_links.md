# Distribution Links

At some point, we want to know that we can get data and manipulate data

we need to check to see that if we can directly access files,
and if not, then we may need to work with repositories on 
* improving links
* proxying data access

# Methods
```python
def isDistDirectAccess(): # need to learn how to guess this
def isDistCloudStorage():
def distPing(url): # does dataset page exist
def isAccessViaServices(): # not everything is a distribution

```

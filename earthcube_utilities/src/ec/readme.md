### earthcube_utliites

#### originally used for notebooks only, but getting more reuse in the rest of the workflow

##### this has caused a natural breakdown of submodules, that can be used as needed

```mermaid
flowchart TD;
U[earthcube_utilities]  -- has --> R[a bit for opening data in notebooks];
U -- loads --> TR[the rest]
TR -- import --> MB[min-base];
TR -- import --> query[SPARQL queries from git];
TR -- import --> R2[rdf2nq];
``` 

### <ins>**earthcube_utilities** breakdown</ins>


#### the file itself can keep some of the notebook specific code or that can go into a notebook/data_download sub modules


#### <ins>__mb.py__ mini-base small util functions</ins> that sometimes end up getting copied into the other places they are needed now
##### some of this could be replaced by libs like: [pydash](https://github.com/dgilland/pydash)


#### <ins>**query.py** is can do all the SPARQL queries the UI can do<ins>
##### it is setup to add one get_{qry_name}\_txt  function to get the txt of the query, usually from raw git
##### then a function: {qry_name} that calls one fuction with {qry_name} as the arg, and maybe a variable
###### it will get the txt from the 1st function, and replace the var w/in the template txt, run the query and return a DF


#### <ins>**rdf2nq.py** takes one form of rdf triples, and adds the filename of the file as the last column in its nquads<ins> output
##### if it is .ntriples, then you just add a column
##### if it is another format like jsonld, then it runs jena's riot RDF I/O technology (RIOT) on it, right now
##### Some related could probably be handled by [kglab](https://derwen.ai/docs/kgl/ex4_0/) now

### There is more that I'm working on the grouping/[breakdown](breakdown.md) [now](sm.md)
#### to include some high level descriptions of possible groupings/(of)functionality
#### and there is the original third sectioned off for the [old](https://github.com/earthcube/ec/blob/master/ect.py) testing, that parts of can integrated w/the new logging..

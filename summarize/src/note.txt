The whole thing can be run by setting S3ADDRESS to the bucket
and running> repo2summary.sh repo
this will get rdf and make a repo.nq file (because runX path's is broken), 
and create repo.ttl summary, that will be used for the 1st line search

In the next PR/step I have something to upload it easily, but for now
you can use the blazegraph dashboard, 
to put in the ttl in summary& nq in earthcube namespaces of your choice
